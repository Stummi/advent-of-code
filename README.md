# Advent of Code

This is my personal repo with AoC solutions written in Kotlin

Some notes:

* Spoilers ahead, obviously.
* There is not much documentation as of now, proceed on your own risk
* The code is not necessary the one I used to solve the problem, since sometimes I refactor it or clean it up after
  solving
* At some point I started to use a small self written framework, but older solutions are still not using it - I might
  or might not clean this up at some point
* I stripped the real input data from the repo, so you have to provide it yourself
    * The newer solutions are using the API to load the input data, so you don't have to bother there
* To setup, put your cookie value into the `cookie` file
